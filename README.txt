This project runs the Classification problem on a list of books to find the ideal tree.
The list of books is hardcoded into the file.
Once the tree is created, the user is asked to create a book to be evaluated.
The user will be asked to enter 3 properties of the book, the binding (soft, or hard), the length (long or short), and color (color or b/w).

Once the user has entered the information, the AI will figure out where that book would fall under on the tree, and output the most likely review for that book.
